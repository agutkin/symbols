RUNNING THE CODE

To run a simulation through 5 epochs for the monosyllabic conditions:

./monosyllable.sh           # Epoch 0
./monosyllable_round01.sh   # Epoch 1
./monosyllable_round02.sh   # Epoch 2
./monosyllable_round03.sh   # Epoch 3
./monosyllable_round04.sh   # Epoch 4
./monosyllable_round05.sh   # Epoch 5

For the disyllable and sesquisyllable conditions, use the similarly
named disyllable.sh, disyllable_round0[1-5].sh, etc.

data from the rounds reported in the book.
